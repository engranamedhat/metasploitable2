# Network Penetration Testing Report

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the need for thorough assessments of network services is paramount. This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities associated with common network protocols and applications, focusing on exploitation techniques within a controlled environment.

## Overview

The report examines multiple network services, including:

- **FTP** (vsFTPD 2.3.4)
- **SSH**
- **SMTP**
- **PHP-CGI**
- **Java RMI**
- **NFS**
- **Distcc**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **VNC**
- **IRC**

Leveraging advanced tools such as **Metasploit**, this assessment demonstrates systematic exploration and exploitation of vulnerabilities. It highlights potential attack vectors, illustrating how attackers may exploit weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.

## Purpose

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding real-world exploitation techniques in a secure and ethical testing environment. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security of networked systems.

Feel free to explore the detailed reports and methodologies for each service in this repository.
